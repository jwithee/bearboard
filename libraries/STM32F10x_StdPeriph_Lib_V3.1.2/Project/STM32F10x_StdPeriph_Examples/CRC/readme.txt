@par Example Description 

This example shows how to use CRC (cyclic redundancy check) calculation unit to 
get a CRC code of a given buffer of data word(32-bit), based on a fixed generator
polynomial(0x4C11DB7).

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F10x Connectivity line, High-Density, Medium-Density 
    and Low-Density Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM3210C-EVAL (STM32F10x 
    Connectivity line), STM3210E-EVAL (STM32F10x High-Density) and STM3210B-EVAL
    (STM32F10x Medium-Density) evaluation boards and can be easily tailored to
    any other supported device and development board.
    To select the STMicroelectronics evaluation board used to run the example, 
    uncomment the corresponding line in stm32_eval.h file (under Utilities\STM32_EVAL)

    
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
- Create a project and setup all project configuration
- Add the required Library files :
  - stm32f10x_rcc.c 
  - stm32f10x_crc.c
  - system_stm32f10x.c (under Libraries\CMSIS\Core\CM3)         
       
- Edit stm32f10x.h file to select the device you are working on.
  
@b Tip: You can tailor the provided project template to run this example, for 
        more details please refer to "stm32f10x_stdperiph_lib_um.chm" user 
        manual; select "Peripheral Examples" then follow the instructions 
        provided in "How to proceed" section.   
- Link all compiled files and load your image into target memory
- Run the example

@note
 - Low-density devices are STM32F101xx and STM32F103xx microcontrollers where
   the Flash memory density ranges between 16 and 32 Kbytes.
 - Medium-density devices are STM32F101xx and STM32F103xx microcontrollers where
   the Flash memory density ranges between 32 and 128 Kbytes.
 - High-density devices are STM32F101xx and STM32F103xx microcontrollers where
   the Flash memory density ranges between 256 and 512 Kbytes.
 - Connectivity line devices are STM32F105xx and STM32F107xx microcontrollers.
