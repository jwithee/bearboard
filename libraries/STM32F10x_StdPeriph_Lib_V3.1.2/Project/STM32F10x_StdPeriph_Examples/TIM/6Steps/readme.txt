@par Example Description 

This example shows how to configure the TIM1 peripheral to generate 6 Steps.
The STM32F10x TIM1 peripheral offers the possibility to program in advance the 
configuration for the next TIM1 outputs behaviour (step) and change the configuration
of all the channels at the same time. This operation is possible when the COM 
(commutation) event is used.
The COM event can be generated by software by setting the COM bit in the TIM1_EGR
register or by hardware (on TRC rising edge).
In this example, a software COM event is generated each 100 ms: using the SysTick 
interrupt.
The TIM1 is configured in Timing Mode, each time a COM event occurs, a new TIM1
configuration will be set in advance.

The break Polarity is used at High level.

The following Table describes the TIM1 Channels states:

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32F10x Connectivity line, High-Density, Medium-Density 
    and Low-Density Devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM3210C-EVAL (STM32F10x 
    Connectivity line), STM3210E-EVAL (STM32F10x High-Density) and STM3210B-EVAL
    (STM32F10x Medium-Density) evaluation boards and can be easily tailored to
    any other supported device and development board.
    

  - STM3210C-EVAL Set-up 
    - Connect the TIM1 pins(TIM1 full remapped pins) to an oscilloscope to monitor the different waveforms:
      - TIM1_CH3  pin (PE.13)
      - TIM1_CH1N pin (PE.08)  
      - TIM1_CH2  pin (PE.11)  
      - TIM1_CH3N pin (PE.12)
      - TIM1_CH1  pin (PE.09)  
      - TIM1_CH2N pin (PE.10)  
    - Connect the TIM1 break pin TIM1_BKIN pin (PE.15) to the GND. To generate a 
      break event, switch this pin level from 0V to 3.3V.     

  - STM3210E-EVAL and STM3210B-EVAL Set-up 
    - Connect the TIM1 pins to an oscilloscope to monitor the different waveforms:
      - TIM1_CH3  pin (PA.10)
      - TIM1_CH1N pin (PB.13)  
      - TIM1_CH2  pin (PA.09)  
      - TIM1_CH3N pin (PB.15)
      - TIM1_CH1  pin (PA.08)  
      - TIM1_CH2N pin (PB.14)    
    - Connect the TIM1 break pin TIM1_BKIN pin (PB.12) to the GND. To generate a 
      break event, switch this pin level from 0V to 3.3V. 
  
  
@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
- Create a project and setup all project configuration
- Add the required Library files:
  - stm32f10x_gpio.c 
  - stm32f10x_rcc.c
  - stm32f10x_tim.c  
  - misc.c
  - system_stm32f10x.c (under Libraries\CMSIS\Core\CM3)
        
- Edit stm32f10x.h file to select the device you are working on.
  
@b Tip: You can tailor the provided project template to run this example, for 
        more details please refer to "stm32f10x_stdperiph_lib_um.chm" user 
        manual; select "Peripheral Examples" then follow the instructions 
        provided in "How to proceed" section.   
- Link all compiled files and load your image into target memory
- Run the example

@note
 - Low-density devices are STM32F101xx and STM32F103xx microcontrollers where
   the Flash memory density ranges between 16 and 32 Kbytes.
 - Medium-density devices are STM32F101xx and STM32F103xx microcontrollers where
   the Flash memory density ranges between 32 and 128 Kbytes.
 - High-density devices are STM32F101xx and STM32F103xx microcontrollers where
   the Flash memory density ranges between 256 and 512 Kbytes.
 - Connectivity line devices are STM32F105xx and STM32F107xx microcontrollers.
